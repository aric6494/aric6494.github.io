      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day, Tom, a cat, wanted to go fishing. Taking up a fishing pole and a bucket, Tom walked to the river. On the way, a butterfly flew past Tom. He said, &amp;ldquo;It was so beautiful; I wanted to catch it.&amp;rdquo; Tom ran after the butterfly. But the butterfly was too swift, so Tom gave up. He said tiredly, &amp;ldquo;If I should see the butterfly next time, I would definitely catch it.&amp;rdquo; Maybe Tom&amp;rsquo;s wish would never be fulfilled, because there were many butterflies that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t distinguish that one among them. Then, he continued on his way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I read &lt;em&gt;The Witches&lt;/em&gt;, an insteresting story. The story is about a boy whose parents died in an accident, and he stayed with his grandmother. While they were on vacation, the boy was turned into a mouse by the witches using a potion called Mouse-Maker. Then he and his grandmother made a plan to put Mouse-Maker into the witches&amp;rsquo; dinner. Then they succeeded and wanted to get rid of all the witches in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

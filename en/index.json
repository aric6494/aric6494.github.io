[{"content":"Recently I read The Witches, an insteresting story. The story is about a boy whose parents died in an accident, and he stayed with his grandmother. While they were on vacation, the boy was turned into a mouse by the witches using a potion called Mouse-Maker. Then he and his grandmother made a plan to put Mouse-Maker into the witches\u0026rsquo; dinner. Then they succeeded and wanted to get rid of all the witches in the world.\nFor me, the reading level of this book is appropriate, so I could read it fluently. If you want to improve English level, reading English novels is a great way.\n","permalink":"https://www.shuohan.work/en/posts/the-witches/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently I read \u003cem\u003eThe Witches\u003c/em\u003e, an insteresting story.

Taking up a fishing pole and a bucket, Tom walked to the river. On the way, a butterfly flew past Tom. He said, \u0026ldquo;It was so beautiful; I wanted to catch it.\u0026rdquo; Tom ran after the butterfly. But the butterfly was too swift, so Tom gave up. He said tiredly, \u0026ldquo;If I should see the butterfly next time, I would definitely catch it.\u0026rdquo; Maybe Tom\u0026rsquo;s wish would never be fulfilled, because there were many butterflies that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t distinguish that one among them. Then, he continued on his way.\nUpon arriving at the river, Tom put down the bucket and sat by the river to fish. As time passed and he became impatient, his fishing pole moved. Tom intently stared at the fishing line, waiting for the right moment. Tom suddenly pulled the fishing pole. But the fish was big and struggled intensely. When Tom thought he would be dragged in the river, his friend Wangwang, a dog, appeared. Wangwang helped Tom pull in the fishing pole, so the fish was pulled from the river. Tom said to Wangwang, \u0026ldquo;Thanks for coming. Let\u0026rsquo;s eat the fish together.\u0026rdquo; Wangwang happily replied, \u0026ldquo;Great! Thank you! If you want to go fishing next time, I could accompany you.\u0026rdquo; Tom joyfully said he would certainly invite Wangwang to go fishing.\nFinally, they happily enjoyed the big fish.\n","permalink":"https://www.shuohan.work/en/posts/tom-the-kitten-goes-fishing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOne day, Tom, a cat, wanted to go fishing.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I read &lt;em&gt;The Witches&lt;/em&gt;, an insteresting story. The story is about a boy whose parents died in an accident, and he stayed with his grandmother. While they were on vacation, the boy was turned into a mouse by the witches using a potion called Mouse-Maker. Then he and his grandmother made a plan to put Mouse-Maker into the witches&amp;rsquo; dinner. Then they succeeded and wanted to get rid of all the witches in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day, Tom, a cat, wanted to go fishing. Taking up a fishing pole and a bucket, Tom walked to the river. On the way, a butterfly flew past Tom. He said, &amp;ldquo;It was so beautiful; I wanted to catch it.&amp;rdquo; Tom ran after the butterfly. But the butterfly was too swift, so Tom gave up. He said tiredly, &amp;ldquo;If I should see the butterfly next time, I would definitely catch it.&amp;rdquo; Maybe Tom&amp;rsquo;s wish would never be fulfilled, because there were many butterflies that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t distinguish that one among them. Then, he continued on his way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
